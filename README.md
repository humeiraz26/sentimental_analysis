# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on **text classification / NLP**, implemented using **NLTK, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The notebook explores preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple models including:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Deep Learning (Keras Sequential with CNN + Embedding layers)**

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Requirements
The notebook uses the following key Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- tensorflow

You can generate a requirements file with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, normalization.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Word embeddings and sequence padding.  
- **Models**: Traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and Deep Learning (CNN with Embedding).  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization with matplotlib/seaborn.

---

## Usage
Open the notebook and run step by step:

```bash
jupyter notebook "ML Project.ipynb"
```

Modify the dataset path inside the notebook if necessary.
